It looks like the larger the array the longer it takes to insert compared to it being a lot less with the smallest array.
But the append array seems to scale a lot better than the insert function unless it comes to an array of less than 100, after that it seems to increase run time exponentially compared to t at a steady rate in comparison with the data it receives.he insert that seems to increase
